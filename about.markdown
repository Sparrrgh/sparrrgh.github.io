Hi! I'm Sparrrgh, a security researcher from Italy.
I have experience in offensive security in various contexts, mainly web and binary exploitation.

I have a passion for optimizing vulnerability research processes, making finding bugs easier and faster. I do this mainly by developing custom SAST and DAST tooling.
Currently, I'm working as a security engineer at Secure Network, in Milan.

## Where to find me
I love sharing my knowledge, especially with people trying to get into cybersecurity.

The **main** way to contact me at the moment is through Twitter, but it could change if I find a better way.
