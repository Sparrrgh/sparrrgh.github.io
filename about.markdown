Hi! I'm Max. I currently work as a Security Engineer at Secure Network, in Italy.

I'm passionate about vulnerability research and exploitation, especially writing tools to make finding vulnerabilities faster and easier!
I've played CTFs for most of my time at the university, and I plan to use this blog to release writeups but most importantly to publish my researches.
