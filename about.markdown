Hi! I'm Max.

I'm an Italian security researcher with experience in offensive security in various contexts, mainly web and binary exploitation.

I have a passion for optimizing vulnerability research processes, making finding bugs easier and faster. I do this mainly by developing custom SAST and DAST tooling.
Currently, I'm working as a security engineer at Secure Network, in Milan.

## Where to find me
I love sharing my knowledge, especially with people trying to get into cybersecurity.

The **main** way to contact me is through email, you can reach me at *max\[at\]sparrrgh\[dot\]me*.
